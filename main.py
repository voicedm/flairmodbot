Making a quick joke about the person in a video or gif is fine. completely being an ass and going on with your political opinions is not fine. No matter what they are.

Whatever you posted was from a TV Show or youtube skit, or something like that. It was scripted, and not genuine, which means we can't really have it on the sub. Sorry.
